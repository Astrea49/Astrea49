# Astrea, the Star Maiden

Hey! I'm just a random girl on here. I'm *far* from being the most skilled at programming, but I make a *bunch* of stuff in Python. It's *mostly* just Discord bots and Discord Python libraries, but sometimes I expand out a bit and dip my toes into other places, too.

Most people know me for my contributions to [`Dis-Snek`](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/Dis-Snek), an extensible and fast Discord Python library. I'm a maintainer there, and I'm also currently working on improving message/prefix commands, which you can see [here with `molter`](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/molter).

I've also worked extensively with [`interactions.py`](https://github.com/interactions-py/library), being a core developer (though I mainly serve in an advisory role) and maintaining [a version of `molter`](https://github.com/interactions-py/molter) for it just for fun.

Of course, I contribute to other Discord Python places, too! [Many](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/63) [`discord.py`](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/147) [forks](https://github.com/iDevision/enhanced-discord.py/commit/fcb2d707a1445fefb22311dc5ffe1b47d0b9bf55) have at least one PR from me. I'm also willing to work with many other wrappers if my interest is ever captured by them, as long as they aren't rude.

Other than that, I also maintain a couple of bots here and there. They're all pretty small and have somewhat niche usages, but they're the main reason why I got into Discord Python library development in the first place.
These include:
- [Seraphim](https://github.com/Astrea49/Seraphim-Bot), the bot that does what other Discord bots don't (or do badly).
- [Realms Playerlist Bot](https://github.com/Astrea49/RealmsPlayerlistBot), a bot that helps out owners of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms by showing a log of players who have joined and left.
- [Ultimate Investigator](https://github.com/Astrea49/UltimateInvestigator), a bot made to help automate investigations during Danganronpa roleplays.
- Some server specific ones that I won't link here, but they're like a second away from being looked at.

Beyong that, there's also miscellaneous projects like [my time zone getter](https://github.com/Astrea49/GetTimeZone) and [my fork of `py-mcws`](https://github.com/Astrea49/py-mcws).

Feel free to take a look around my repos! If you need to contact me, I'd prefer Discord (Astrea#7171) since I'm *very* active on there. Otherwise, enjoy!

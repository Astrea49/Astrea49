# Astrea

Hey! I'm just a random girl on here. I'm *far* from being the most skilled at programming, but I make a *bunch* of stuff in Python. It's *mostly* just Discord bots, but sometimes I expand out a bit and dip my toes into other places, too.

My main project as of right now is [Seraphim](https://github.com/Astrea49/Seraphim-Bot), and it really should be no surprise. It's my multi-purpose bot that is meant to do what other bots do not or fail to do. I'll admit that while it *is* public, it also isn't being advertised everywhere as I do not have the money for a host to keep it running if it expands beyond a certain point. Kinda sucks, huh?

Feel free to take a look around my repos! If you need to contact me, I'd prefer Discord (Astrea#7171) since I'm *very* active on there, but I also do have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Astrea49) that I check from time to time. Otherwise, enjoy!
